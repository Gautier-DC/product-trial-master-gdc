# ALTEN SHOP FRONT

Hello there ! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to Alten front shop, a little project around an e-commerce shop. You can check some products displayed in cards, send them to your cart and remove them if you have some remorse to buy it !

Also you can send a message thanks to contact page (or it's more a simulation).

# FEATURES

- Display some products with inventory status
- Add products to the cart
- Check and remove products from the cart
- Contact form with field validation

# INSTALLATION

The project run with angular so be shure to have latest version of Node.js and angular client installed.

After that, go on and do your best `npm install`

Now you can launch the front-end with `ng serve` or `npm start`.

# TECHNOLOGIES

- Angular for front-end
- PrimeNG for UI Component
- Tailwind, CSS and SASS for style (maybe it's too much ? ðŸ¤”)

# NEXT STEP

- Revamp of the design, it's efficient but not shiny !
- Global refactoring, to much styling component and side effects
